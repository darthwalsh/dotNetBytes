dotNetBytes
===========

Have you ever wondered what was inside your C# EXE or DLL? Have you ever tried to modify a binary and got some weird CLR exception? dotNetBytes can help.

There are many good .NET dissassemblers out there, and there are many good visual explanations of what the pieces of a .NET assembly are. I wanted the best of both worlds, having a tool to create a custom visualization of my assemblies.

Features
--------
- See a structured view of the PE file header, CLI metadata, and of course the bytecode.
- Understand little endian numbers, bit flags, and string blobs though the detai view on the right.
- Errors are listed in the details.
